NTP Client
This NTP client is similar in nature to ntpdate but does not accept any command line arguments nor does it update the system clock. Note that this NTP client does not use any NTP libraries but rather works directly at the https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc958.

The program derives from https://github.com/lettier/ntpclient

This is an windows port of that using winsock.
